What is SystemInstaller?
----------------------->

 * Based on design concepts of ACMEInstaller, SystemInstaller is an open-source tool
   designed to be a configurable OS installer for the HP TouchPad. Hopefully in the 
   near future, we are going to unify the SystemInstaller with the uninstaller and
   create a nice little GUI to eleminate the need for a config file.

What is SystemUninstaller?
------------------------->

 * SystemUninstaller simply reverses what SystemInstaller does. :)

How do I use SystemInstaller?
---------------------------->

 * SystemInstaller is designed with simplicity in mind. You will need to have the following to use it:

     => A Linux/Mac/Windows computer. (You will need a Linux or Mac computer if you wish to build from source).

     => A little tool from HP/Palm called novacom, you gan grab it from the bottom of the page at http://opensource.palm.com/packages.html .

     => A file called install.conf (this is your configuration file - configure to your preference, keep name as install.conf)
        See doc/install.conf.example for an example.

     => A root filesystem image of the OS you wish to install. (This can be in tar/gzip or tar/bzip format, but *MUST* have 'rootfs' in it's filename).

     => A kernel image for the OS you wish to install. (The name of this file should just be 'uImage' and nothing more).

     => A small bootloader program called moboot, you can obtain a copy at http://code.google.com/p/moboot - do NOT change the file name or unpack the zip!
        (NOTE: the bootloader is not necessary as SystemInstaller provides it's own, but it is highly recommended that you provide your own updated copy)

 * To run SystemInstaller, use the following steps:

    1.) If you are rebuilding from source, cd into the source directory and type 'make'. this will generate the installer/uninstaller. Otherwise skip to 2.

    2.) Plug the HP TouchPad into your computer and make sure it is mounted. (you should see 'HP TOUCHPAD' under 'My Compyter' in Windows, in 'Places' under
        Ubuntu Linux, or on the desktop in Mac OSX.

    3.) When you navigate to 'HP TOUCHPAD', create a folder called 'osinstall.d' and place your config file, kernel, rootfs archive, and bootloader in that folder.

    4.) Shut down your HP TouchPad, then press the power and volume up buttons to activate bootie mode - you should see a usb logo appear on the tablet's screen.

    5.) Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to where SystemInstaller is located on your computer, and run:
        novacom boot mem:// < SystemInstaller

        Please be patient as the installer will take anything from a couple of minutes to an hour depending on the size of your OS installation.
        You can watch the tablet's screen for activity and any notices/warnings as the installation takes place.

    6.) After the installation is completed, the tablet should reboot into moboot's boot menu. Use the volume buttons and home button to make your selection. Enjoy!


How do I use SystemUninstaller?
------------------------------>

    1.) Follow steps 2 and 4 above.

    2.) Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to where SystemUninstaller is located on your computer, and run:
        novacom boot mem:// < SystemUninstaller

        Wait a minute or two for the uninstaller to do it's work. your done!
